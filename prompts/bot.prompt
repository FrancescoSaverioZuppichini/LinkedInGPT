🚨 New paper alert: Segment Everything Everywhere All at Once 🤖🎨📷


Despite the growing demand for interactive AI systems, there have been few comprehensive studies on human-AI interaction in visual understanding e.g. segmentation. Inspired by the development of prompt-based universal interfaces for LLMs, this paper presents SEEM, a promptable, interactive model for Segmenting Everything 


Everywhere all at once in an image. SEEM has four desiderata: 


✅ Versatility: by introducing a versatile prompting engine for different types of prompts, including points, boxes, scribbles, masks, texts, and referred regions of another image; 
✅ Compositionality: by learning a joint visual-semantic space for visual and 
textual prompts to compose queries on the fly for inference as shown in Fig 1; 
✅ Interactivity: by incorporating learnable memory prompts to retain dialog history information via mask-guided cross-attention; and 
✅ Semantic-awareness: by using a text encoder to encode text queries and mask labels for open-vocabulary 
segmentation.
